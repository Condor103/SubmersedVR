Credits/Thanks
--------------

This mod began as modifications and fixes for the [SN1MC] Mod from [ihatetn931] and later was mostly rewritten and cleaned up for this project.
Lots of thanks to him opening up the source code for me to get into VR Modding.

Furthermore, there are some fixes and improvements cherry-picked from the [Subnautica VR Enhancements Mod] by [IWhoI].

Another thanks goes to the great VR modding work from [Raicuparta]. I looked at their mods code quite often when I was stuck and probably will again in the future.
